Project Setup and Running Instructions
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Google Colab or a similar Jupyter notebook environment ready to run IPYNB files before you begin.

Code Organization
Model Implementation: You'll find the code for both Random Forest and Logistic Regression models under the Model_code directory.
Data Setup
Dataset: Access the voting_refined_data dataset located within the datasets folder, which is nested inside the EDA folder.
How to Run the Notebook
Choose either the local setup or Google Colab method based on your preference:

For Local Setup
Download the voting_refined_data and place it in the same directory as your notebook.
Update the dataset's file path in the notebook to point to its new local location.
For Google Colab Setup
Upload the dataset to your Google Drive.
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run the first cell to mount your Google Drive.
Adjust the dataset's file path in the notebook to match its location in your Drive.
Running the Notebook
Simply execute the notebook cells in order from top to bottom to load your data, run the models, and see the results.
